# Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project performs basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the famous Titanic dataset.

## Objectives
- Understand survival rates based on gender, class, and age.
- Handle missing values in the dataset.
- Create visualizations to gain insights.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## How to Run
1. Install required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
    ```
2. Run the Python file:
    ```bash
